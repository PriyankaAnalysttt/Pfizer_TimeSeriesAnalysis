```


Analysis:
Objective: To analyze the daily returns and price variation of Pfizer stock from 2018-01-01 to 2023-12-31.
Analysis: Extracted the adjusted closing prices of Pfizer stock, calculated daily returns, and visualized them.
Result:
The 'PFE_return' plot displays the daily returns of Pfizer stock over the specified period.
Implication: 
The plot indicates the volatility and direction of daily returns for Pfizer stock during the given timeframe.
Observations from the plot can help investors understand the historical performance and risk associated with Pfizer stock.

```

```{r}
adf_test_ret = adf.test(PFE_return)

```

Analysis:

Objective: To conduct an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity on the daily returns of Pfizer stock.
Analysis: Performed the ADF test using the 'adf.test' function and obtained results.
Result:
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on Pfizer daily returns yields the following results:
  - Dickey-Fuller statistic: -11.486
  - Lag order: 11
  - p-value: 0.01
  - Alternative hypothesis: Stationary

Implication: 
The ADF test suggests that the daily returns of Pfizer stock are likely stationary. The small p-value (0.01) indicates evidence against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. Therefore, we have reason to believe that the Pfizer stock returns exhibit stationarity, which is important for certain time series analyses.

#Autocorrelation test
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test_ds = Box.test(PFE_return); lb_test_ds


```

Analysis:

Objective: To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the daily returns of Pfizer stock.
Analysis: Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function and obtained results.
Result:
The Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on Pfizer daily returns yields the following results:
  - X-squared statistic: 4.2327
  - Degrees of freedom: 1
  - p-value: 0.03965

Implication:
The Ljung-Box test indicates significant autocorrelation in the Pfizer stock daily returns. The small p-value 0.03965 suggests evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

Action:
Given the presence of autocorrelation, it may be advisable to consider an autoARIMA model for time series forecasting. AutoARIMA can help in automatically selecting an appropriate ARIMA model with differencing to account for the observed autocorrelation.

#AutoArima
arma_pq_ds = auto.arima(PFE_return); arma_pq_ds
arma_pq = auto.arima(PFE_price); arma_pq

```

Analysis:

Objective: To perform autoARIMA modeling on the daily returns ('PFE_return') and adjusted closing prices ('PFE_price') of Pfizer stock.
Analysis: Used the 'auto.arima' function to automatically select the ARIMA model for both returns and prices.
Results:

For Daily Returns ('PFE_return'):
The autoARIMA model suggests an ARIMA(0,0,1) with zero mean.
Coefficients:
  - MA: ma1
  - sigma^2 (variance) = 0.000262
  - Log likelihood = -8154.03
  - AIC = 4295.14, AICc = -8154.02 , BIC =-8143.39

For Adjusted Closing Prices ('ITC_price'):
The autoARIMA model suggests an ARIMA(5,0,3) with a non-zero mean.
Coefficients:
  
  - Mean: mean term
  - sigma^2 (variance) = 0.347
  - Log likelihood = -1341.65
  - AIC=2685.31   AICc=2685.31   BIC=2690.63
  

Implication:
The autoARIMA models provide a statistical framework to capture the underlying patterns in both daily returns and adjusted closing prices of ITC stock. These models can be used for forecasting future values, and the AIC, AICc, and BIC values help in model comparison.

PFE_return:

The ARIMA(0,0,1) model indicates that the series PFE_return is better explained by a moving average component with one lag (MA(1)) and no autoregressive or differencing components.
The estimated coefficient for the MA(1) term is -0.0517, suggesting that the current value of the series is negatively influenced by the previous value with a lag of one period.
The small residual variance (sigma^2 = 0.000262) indicates that the model effectively captures the variability in the data.
The AIC, AICc, and BIC values are all negative, indicating a good fit of the model to the data.

PFE_price:

The ARIMA(0,1,0) model indicates that the series PFE_price is better explained by a first-order differencing component and no autoregressive or moving average components.
The estimated residual variance (sigma^2 = 0.347) is relatively high compared to the residual variance in the PFE_return model, suggesting that there may be some unexplained variability in the data.
The log likelihood value is negative, indicating that the model does not fit the data as well as the model for PFE_return.
The AIC, AICc, and BIC values are positive, indicating a less optimal fit of the model to the data compared to the model for PFE_return.


```{r}

#Arima manuplation
arma1 = arima(PFE_return, order = c(0, 0, 1)); arma1
ds_fpq = forecast(arma1, h = 500)
plot(ds_fpq)

```

Analysis:

Objective: To fit an ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model to the daily returns ('PFE_return') of PFE stock and generate forecasts.
Analysis: Used the 'arima' function to fit the ARIMA model and the 'forecast' function to generate forecasts.
Results:

ARIMA Model (0, 0, 1):

Forecasting:
Generated forecasts for the next 500 time points using the fitted ARIMA model.

Plot:
The plot displays the original time series of daily returns along with the forecasted values.

Implication:
The ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model is fitted to the historical daily returns of ITC stock, providing insights into the underlying patterns. The generated forecast can be used for future predictions, and the plot visually represents the model's performance.

#Autocorrelation test
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test_ds_A = Box.test(arma1$residuals); lb_test_ds_A
#After this no autocorrelation exists


```

Analysis:

Objective: To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the residuals of the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model.
Analysis: Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function on the residuals of the ARIMA model and obtained results.
Results:

Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation on Residuals:
  - X-squared statistic: 0.00096823
  - Degrees of freedom: 1
  - p-value:0.9752


Implication:
The Ljung-Box test indicates no significant autocorrelation in the residuals of the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model. The high p-value (0.9775) suggests that there is no evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

Action:
The absence of autocorrelation in residuals is a positive outcome, indicating that the ARIMA model adequately captures the temporal patterns in the time series.

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: Box Test 
stk_ret_sq = arma1$residuals^2 # Return Variance (Since Mean Returns is approx. 0)
plot(stk_ret_sq)
stk_ret_sq_box_test = Box.test(stk_ret_sq, lag = 11) # H0: Return Variance Series is Not Serially Correlated
stk_ret_sq_box_test # Inference : Return Variance Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
stk_ret_arch_test = ArchTest(arma1$residuals, lags = 11) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)

```

Analysis:
Objective: To test for volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the residuals of the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model.
Analysis: Conducted Box test and ARCH test on the squared residuals to assess the presence of volatility clustering.
Results:

1. Box Test for Volatility Clustering:
   - X-squared statistic: 490.02
   - Degrees of freedom: 11
   - p-value: < 2.2e-16
   Inference: The Box test indicates significant evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the return variance series exhibits volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity.

2. ARCH Test for Volatility Clustering:
   - Chi-squared statistic: 197.96
   - Degrees of freedom: 10
   - p-value: < 2.2e-16
   Inference: The ARCH test also provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, supporting the presence of ARCH effects in the return series. This implies that the returns have volatility clustering.

Implication:
The results from both tests suggest that the residuals of the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model exhibit volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity. Understanding and accounting for this pattern in volatility is essential for risk management and forecasting.

garch_model2 = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(0,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0,1), include.mean = FALSE))
nse_ret_garch2 = ugarchfit(garch_model2, data = arma1$residuals); nse_ret_garch2

# Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
gar_resd2 = residuals(nse_ret_garch2)^2
stk_ret_arch_test2 = ArchTest(gar_resd2, lags = 1) # H0: No ARCH Effects
stk_ret_arch_test2 # Inference : Return Series is Heteroskedastic (Has Volatility Clustering)

```
Analysis:
Objective: To fit GARCH models to the residuals of the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model and test for volatility clustering.
Analysis: Fitted two GARCH model to the residuals and performed an ARCH test on squared residuals.
Results:

GARCH Model:
   - sGARCH(0,1) model with ARFIMA(0,0,1) mean.
  - Optimal parameters are not provided in the output.
   - Weighted Ljung-Box Test on Standardized Residuals and Squared Residuals show significant autocorrelation.
   - Weighted ARCH LM Tests indicate evidence of ARCH effects.


ARCH Test on Squared Residuals:
   - Lag[1] statistic: 49.07
   - Lag[2*(p+q)+(p+q)-1][5] statistic: 57.97
   - Lag[4*(p+q)+(p+q)-1][9] statistic: 70.25
   - p-value: < 1.366e-11

   Inference: The ARCH test confirms the presence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the residuals.

Implication:
GARCH model suggest that the residuals exhibit volatility clustering. The ARCH test further supports the presence of heteroskedasticity in the squared residuals.


```{r}

garch_modelf = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(0,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0,1), include.mean = FALSE))
stk_ret_garch = ugarchfit(garch_modelf, data = PFE_return); stk_ret_garch
```

Analysis:

Objective: To fit a GARCH model to the daily returns of Pfizer stock and assess the goodness-of-fit using the Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test.
Analysis: Used the 'ugarchspec' and 'ugarchfit' functions to fit a GARCH model and performed the Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test.
Results:

GARCH Model:
   - sGARCH(0,1) model with ARFIMA(0,0,1) mean.
   - Optimal Parameters:
      ma1    0.1993
      omega 14.0797
      beta1  0.3923


Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test:
   - The test was performed for different group sizes (20, 30, 40, and 50).
   - For each group size, the test statistic and p-value were calculated.
   - All p-values are extremely low (e.g., 3.193e-18), indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of a good fit.

Implication:
The Adjusted Pearson Goodness-of-Fit Test suggests that the fitted GARCH model may not provide a good fit to the observed daily returns of Pfizer stock. The low p-values indicate a significant discrepancy between the model and the observed data.



```{r}
